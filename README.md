> Three dataset: “twitter_archive_enhanced.csv”, “image_predictions.tsv” and “twitter_api.py” with \~2,500 data is warngled (Gathered, assessed, and cleaned ) in this project.

## Summary of Findings

> I analyzed the data by coding and visualizing them. The questions and the found answers are as:
Questions for codding section:

1. What is the population of each dog "stage" (doggo,floofer,pupper,puppo) in the data? Answer: The pupper has the most counts.

2. How the overal number of "favorite_count"s changes year by year? Answer: The “favorite_count"s of dogs has been increasing by time. 3. Is there any relationship between number of posted pictures and average rating_numerator and average favorite_count? Answer: By increasing the number of posted figures, both rating_numerator , favorite_count has been increases.
Questions for visualization section: 1. How confidence of image prediction can change by average number of posted pictures? Answer: definition of 4 groups of confidences.
- low: [0, 0.4]
- moderate_low: [0.4, 0.6]
- moderate_high: [0.6, 0.8]
- high: [0.8, 1]

3. How the number of posted figures affect the rating_numerator and favorite_counts?
By increasing the number of posted figures, both rating_numerator (A and B) and favorite_count has been increased.

**Limitations:** I do not have a good understanding about the collected data and the prediction models. This may bring many uncertainties.
